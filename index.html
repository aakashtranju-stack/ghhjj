            <article class="card"><p><strong>Arjun K.</strong><br/>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p><p>“I’m 27 and always been the quiet guy. Not bad looking, decent job, but girls just didn’t see me that way. I would match on apps but conversations died fast. This system helped me understand small things I was doing wrong — over-texting, being too available, acting impressed too easily. I made some changes and within a few weeks I went on multiple dates. I ended up sleeping with one girl I met through an app. For the first time I felt like I wasn’t just the ‘nice guy.’”</p></article>
            <article class="card"><p><strong>Rishabh T.</strong><br/>⭐⭐⭐⭐☆</p><p>“I’m an introvert and I overthink a lot. My biggest issue was confidence during dates. I would talk too much or go completely silent. What helped me most was learning how to stay calm and slow things down. Eye contact, physical touch at the right time, not rushing. I’ve had two hookups in the last few months. That’s more than my entire previous life combined. It actually works if you apply it.”</p></article>
            <article class="card"><p><strong>Manav S.</strong><br/>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p><p>“I used to get friend-zoned every single time. Girls liked talking to me but nothing physical ever happened. I didn’t know how to escalate without feeling awkward. The Quiet Attraction System explains things in a practical way. No cringe pickup lines. Just how to create tension naturally. I tried it with a girl I had known for months. We went from casual chatting to hooking up in about 3 weeks. I didn’t become someone else. I just stopped being scared to lead.”</p></article>
            <article class="card"><p><strong>Dev A.</strong><br/>⭐⭐⭐⭐☆</p><p>“Earlier I thought you need money, looks, or extrovert personality. I had none of that. The biggest change for me was mindset. Stop chasing. Stop proving. Just be grounded. Now girls respond better to me and I’ve had more success in the last 3 months than the last 5 years. It’s not magic, but it definitely shifts how women see you.”</p></article>

          <h2>Imagine this…</h2>
          <h3>Just one week from today…</h3>
          <p>One week from now<br/>You talk without your chest feeling tight. Words come out normally.</p>
          <p>You do not replay conversations in your head anymore. You say something and move on.</p>
          <p>Women reply properly. Not one-word answers. Not silence.</p>
          <p>You notice small signs you missed before. Interest feels clearer.</p>
          <p>You stop wondering what to say next. You already know.</p>
          <p>For the first time, dating does not feel confusing. It feels simple.</p>
          <p>You realise something important. This is not luck. You’re finally doing it the right way.</p>

          <h3>Just one month from now…</h3>
          <p>You feel normal around women. No rush in your head. No tight feeling.</p>
          <p>Conversations do not stall anymore. They move somewhere.</p>
          <p>You can tell when she is interested. You do not guess. You do not hope.</p>
          <p>You talk, you meet, things progress. Not every time, but often enough to know it works.</p>
          <p>Women who once felt out of reach now feel possible. Some even show interest first.</p>
          <p>Dating stops feeling confusing. You understand what to do and when to do it.</p>
          <p>It no longer feels like luck. It feels like a skill you are learning and using.</p>

          <h3>3 months down the line...</h3>
          <p>You feel comfortable in your own skin. You do not try to impress.</p>
          <p>When you speak, women pay attention. They listen. They stay.</p>
          <p>You know when interest is real. You do not chase guesses anymore.</p>
          <p>You have choices now. You are not stuck on one option.</p>
          <p>Some conversations fade. Others move forward easily. And you know why.</p>
          <p>Dating feels normal. Not stressful. Not confusing.</p>
          <p>This is not luck. You understand attraction now, and it shows.</p>
